# Backround
The CompTIA Security+ is a widely recognized certification in the cybersecurity field demonstrating knowledge in fundamental skills necessary for the industry. The exam consists of 90 questions including multiple choice and performance based simulations across 5 major domains. I spent 2 months preparing for this exam and received a passing score. 
# Resources Utlizied 
The resources I utilized to pass the exam are provided below. I would highly recommend the materials listed as they provide a thorough coverage of the exam objectives. In addition to those materials I frequently referenced the exam study guide as well. To prepare for the exam I took digital notes on both video courses based on the lectures and study guides provided respectively. Then I took hand-written notes on sections I found to be especially important or that I wanted to really lock in my understanding of. Following this I utilized flashcards to practice learning concepts and acronyms relevant to the exam. Finally, I took multiple practice exams and revisited sections I scored poorly in. 

Resources I used:
* Jason Dions' Udemy Course
* Jason Dions' Practice Exams
* Professor Messer's Free Videos
* Professor Messer's Practice Exams
* Professor Messer's Study Guide

# Exam Tips
Going into the exam, you will be given a sheet of paper or a whiteboard to take notes on. Use the material provided to dump concepts you’ve spent time learning but may benefit from having written down. In my case this included the OSI model and common ports and protocols. When starting the exam I would recommend skipping the performance based simulations as the multiple choice questions will make up the bulk of the exam and be easier to handle. Note that CompTIA specifically words their questions in a format intended to confuse and mislead you. Stay focused and don’t overthink you;re answer. Look for keywords in the question phrasing and use deductive reasoning to eliminate answers that obviously don’t make sense for the question. 
# Closing Thoughts
Overall I found the exam to be moderately challenging. I came in with a solid understanding of the exam objectives and my end score definitely reflected that. While the Security+ doesn't qualify me for any professional positions, it does demonstrate my understanding of fundamentals cybersecurity subjects and my commitment to learn more and succeed in the industry.
